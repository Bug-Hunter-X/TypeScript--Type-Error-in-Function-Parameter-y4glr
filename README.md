# TypeScript Type Error
This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: passing an array to a function expecting a string.
The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a corrected version.
The error arises from a type mismatch between the function's parameter and the argument passed to it. The solution involves either modifying the function's signature to accept an array or processing the array elements appropriately before passing them to the function.
